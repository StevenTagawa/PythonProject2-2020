# 1) This script is coded for "exceeds expectations."

# 2) Additionally, this script distributes players as evenly as possible by height, so that no team has a height advantage.

# 3) This script is proofed against missing or corrupted data from the imported constants.py file, warning the user if data is missing or corrupted, but supplying default values rather than ending.

# 4) If not enough players are provided to create the number of teams specified, this script will warn the user and exit.
